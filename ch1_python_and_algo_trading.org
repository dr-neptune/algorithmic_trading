#+TITLE: Chapter 1: Python and Algorithmic Trading

This is mostly an overview of python, associated packages, and basic
descriptions of trading terminology.

A list of some financial trading motives:

- beta trading
  - earning market risk premia by investing in, for instance, exchange
    traded funds (ETFs) that replicate the performance of the S&P 500
- alpha generation
  - earning risk premia independent of the market by, for example,
    selling short stocks listed in the S&P 500 or ETFs on the S&P 500
- static hedging
  - hedging against market risks by buying, for example, out of the
    money put options on the S&P 500
- dynamic hedging
  - hedging against market risks affecting options on the S&P 500 by,
    for example, dynamically trading futures on the S&P 500 and
    appropriate cash, money market, or rate instruments
- asset-liability management
  - trading S&P 500 stocks and ETFs to be able to cover liabilities
    resulting from, for example, writing life insurance policies
- market making
  - providing, for example, liquidity to options on the S&P 500 by
    buying and selling options at different bid and ask prices
